VOCA aims to facilitate the learning process for acquiring new English vocabulary in an active and contextual way. After an initial set of questions, VOCA statistically infers a rough range of words that the reader knows. Starting from the 5,000 most common words to higher numbers, depending on the user’s performance in the initial test, VOCA’s bank of words then adapts itself accordingly.  By excluding known words, VOCA then determines the vocabulary the reader potentially does not know while reading a text on the screen. By underlining them in a different color, VOCA allows for an interaction with the word, leading the user to find out about its definition in English, Chinese translation, grammar categorizations, examples in other texts, and other detailed features we discuss below.
